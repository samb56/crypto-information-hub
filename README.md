Our team project is focused around Crypto currency knowledge, we believe that there are many other crypto websites that display base information regarding cryptocurrency. However there is an educational component that is lacking, many people are intididated by the amount of colorful graphs, pie chart this, candle graghs and HODL. We wanted to create a simplier application that will allow user to see end point information for crypto, the things the everyday layman wants information about at a glance. The app is desinged to deliver quick and concise information regrading your searched crypto as well as relevant news articles that can explain certain moveent in it's valuation. We are planning on future additions to the application to include a full interactive educational system that will show the basis of what crypto is and basic principles of the block chain. 

In this we utilized local storage to store and dispaly previous searches from the user input so that they can always access their top crypto currency. In addition we utilized several different API's to gather information regarding the searched crypto. Such as full market name, pricing, and etc. We used a new framework called Skeleton for it's ease of use and simplicity to offer a clean and lean design.
